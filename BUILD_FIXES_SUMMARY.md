# Build Fixes Summary - Radar Tracking System

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve compilation errors in the radar tracking system build.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Protobuf Enum Conflicts
**Problem**: Enum value `CUSTOM` was defined multiple times in the same namespace `radar.messages`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `protocols/protobuf/track_messages.proto`

**Changes**:
- Renamed enum values to be unique:
  - `FilterType::CUSTOM` â†’ `FilterType::FILTER_CUSTOM`
  - `ClusteringAlgorithm::CUSTOM` â†’ `ClusteringAlgorithm::CLUSTERING_CUSTOM`
  - `AssociationAlgorithm::CUSTOM` â†’ `AssociationAlgorithm::ASSOCIATION_CUSTOM`

### 2. TrackState Naming Conflict
**Problem**: `TrackState` was defined both as an enum class and as a struct in the same namespace.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/common/include/common/types.hpp`

**Changes**:
- Renamed the struct from `TrackState` to `TrackStateVector`
- Updated all references in the Track struct:
  - `TrackState current_state` â†’ `TrackStateVector current_state`
  - `TrackState predicted_state` â†’ `TrackStateVector predicted_state`
  - `std::vector<TrackState> state_history` â†’ `std::vector<TrackStateVector> state_history`

### 3. Missing Header Files
**Problem**: `association/hungarian_algorithm.hpp` was missing.

**Files Created**:
- `shared/processing/association/include/association/hungarian_algorithm.hpp`

**Changes**:
- Created complete header file for the Hungarian Algorithm class
- Added all necessary method declarations and documentation

### 4. Missing Include Files
**Problem**: Missing `#include <set>` in GNN implementation.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/processing/association/src/gnn.cpp`

**Changes**:
- Added `#include <set>` to fix `std::set` usage
- Added `#include "association/hungarian_algorithm.hpp"` for Hungarian algorithm integration

### 5. Missing Struct Members
**Problem**: Various structs were missing expected members.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/common/include/common/types.hpp`

**Changes**:

#### Association Struct:
- Added `double likelihood{0.0}`
- Added `AssociationAlgorithm algorithm{AssociationAlgorithm::NEAREST_NEIGHBOR}`
- Added `Vector3d innovation`
- Added `Matrix3d innovation_covariance`

#### DetectionCluster Struct:
- Added `uint32_t detection_count{0}`
- Added `double cluster_radius{0.0}`
- Added `double cluster_density{0.0}`

### 6. Missing Enum Values
**Problem**: `JPDA` was not defined in `AssociationAlgorithm` enum.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/common/include/common/types.hpp`

**Changes**:
- Added `JPDA = JOINT_PROBABILISTIC` as an alias to support both naming conventions

### 7. Interface Method Mismatches
**Problem**: `ClusteringResult` type didn't exist in interfaces.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/processing/clustering/include/clustering/hierarchical_clustering.hpp`

**Changes**:
- Updated method signatures to return `std::vector<common::DetectionCluster>` instead of `interfaces::ClusteringResult`
- Fixed both the `cluster()` method and `createClusteringResult()` method

### 8. Missing Method Implementations
**Problem**: GNN was calling `solveAssignment()` method that wasn't declared or implemented.

**Files Fixed**:
- `shared/processing/association/include/association/gnn.hpp`
- `shared/processing/association/src/gnn.cpp`

**Changes**:
- Added `solveAssignment()` method declaration to header
- Implemented `solveAssignment()` method using Hungarian algorithm
- Integrated Hungarian algorithm dependency

## Dependencies Installed

### System Packages:
- `libprotobuf-dev` - Protocol Buffers development files
- `protobuf-compiler` - Protocol Buffers compiler
- `libeigen3-dev` - Eigen3 linear algebra library
- `libyaml-cpp-dev` - YAML parsing library
- `libspdlog-dev` - Fast C++ logging library

## Remaining Issues (In Progress)

The build is now progressing much further but still has some issues to resolve:

1. **Type Mismatches**: Some files still reference the old `TrackState` struct instead of `TrackStateVector`
2. **Sign Comparison Warnings**: Some comparisons between signed and unsigned integers
3. **Const Correctness**: Some methods need const qualifiers
4. **Protobuf Generation Issues**: Minor conflicts in generated protobuf code

## Status

âœ… **Resolved**: Major structural issues, missing files, and dependency problems
ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Type mismatches and compilation warnings
ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**: Fix remaining type issues and sign comparison warnings

## Files Modified

### Headers Created:
- `shared/processing/association/include/association/hungarian_algorithm.hpp`

### Headers Modified:
- `shared/common/include/common/types.hpp`
- `shared/processing/association/include/association/gnn.hpp`
- `shared/processing/clustering/include/clustering/hierarchical_clustering.hpp`

### Source Files Modified:
- `shared/processing/association/src/gnn.cpp`

### Protocol Files Modified:
- `protocols/protobuf/track_messages.proto`

## Build Progress

The build now successfully:
- âœ… Configures CMake without dependency errors
- âœ… Generates protobuf files without enum conflicts
- âœ… Starts compilation of multiple source files
- âœ… Resolves most type definition conflicts
- ðŸ”„ Working on final compilation issues

The system is now much closer to a successful build with most fundamental issues resolved.
